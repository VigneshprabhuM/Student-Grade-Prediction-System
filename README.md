### Data Set Information:
This dataset evaluates student achievement in secondary education at two Portuguese schools. It includes student grades, demographic, social, and school-related features, collected through school reports and questionnaires. Two datasets are provided for performance in Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por), modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. The target attribute G3 has a strong correlation with G2 and G1, as G3 represents the final year grade while G1 and G2 correspond to the 1st and 2nd period grades, respectively.

### Attribute Information:
- **school**: Student's school ('GP' - Gabriel Pereira or 'MS' - Mousinho da Silveira)
- **sex**: Student's sex ('F' - female or 'M' - male)
- **age**: Student's age (numeric: from 15 to 22)
- **address**: Student's home address type ('U' - urban or 'R' - rural)
- **famsize**: Family size ('LE3' - less or equal to 3 or 'GT3' - greater than 3)
- **Pstatus**: Parent's cohabitation status ('T' - living together or 'A' - apart)
- **Medu**: Mother's education (0 - none, 1 - primary education, 2 - 5th to 9th grade, 3 - secondary education, 4 - higher education)
- **Fedu**: Father's education (same scale as Medu)
- **Mjob**: Mother's job ('teacher', 'health', 'services', 'at_home', or 'other')
- **Fjob**: Father's job (same categories as Mjob)
- **reason**: Reason for choosing the school ('home', 'reputation', 'course', or 'other')
- **guardian**: Student's guardian ('mother', 'father', or 'other')
- **traveltime**: Home to school travel time (1 - <15 min., 2 - 15 to 30 min., 3 - 30 min. to 1 hour, 4 - >1 hour)
- **studytime**: Weekly study time (1 - <2 hours, 2 - 2 to 5 hours, 3 - 5 to 10 hours, 4 - >10 hours)
- **failures**: Number of past class failures (n if 1<=n<3, else 4)
- **schoolsup**: Extra educational support (yes or no)
- **famsup**: Family educational support (yes or no)
- **paid**: Extra paid classes within the course subject (yes or no)
- **activities**: Extra-curricular activities (yes or no)
- **nursery**: Attended nursery school (yes or no)
- **higher**: Wants to take higher education (yes or no)
- **internet**: Internet access at home (yes or no)
- **romantic**: With a romantic relationship (yes or no)
- **famrel**: Quality of family relationships (1 - very bad to 5 - excellent)
- **freetime**: Free time after school (1 - very low to 5 - very high)
- **goout**: Going out with friends (1 - very low to 5 - very high)
- **Dalc**: Workday alcohol consumption (1 - very low to 5 - very high)
- **Walc**: Weekend alcohol consumption (1 - very low to 5 - very high)
- **health**: Current health status (1 - very bad to 5 - very good)
- **absences**: Number of school absences (0 to 93)
- **G1**: First period grade (0 to 20)
- **G2**: Second period grade (0 to 20)
- **G3**: Final grade (0 to 20, output target)



## Packages

### NumPy
- Python library for numerical computations.

### Pandas
- Python library for data manipulation and analysis.

### Matplotlib
- Python library for data visualization.

## Data Visualization

Data visualization plays a crucial role in understanding and analyzing the dataset. Some examples of visualization techniques used in this project are:

- **Visualizing the Regression Line:** Visualization of the regression line to understand the relationship between different variables.
- **Scatterplot:** Utilizing scatterplots to visualize the relationship between study time and final grades.
- **Correlation Matrix:** Displaying a correlation matrix to identify patterns and relationships between variables.
- **Residual Analysis:** Analyzing residuals to assess the fit of the regression model.

## Evaluating Model

Model evaluation is essential for understanding the performance of machine learning models. In this project, we evaluate the model using various metrics, including R-squared value, mean squared error, and mean absolute error.
