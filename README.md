# Student-Grade-Prediction-System
Universities are very prestigious places to access higher education. But the amount of fees universities charge today never equals the support they give to students. Some students need a lot of attention from instructors because if special attention will not be given to those students who are not getting good grades, it could be detrimental to their emotional state and their career in the long run.

By using machine learning algorithms, we can predict how well the students are going to perform so that we can help the students whose grades are predicted low. Student Grades Prediction is based on the problem of regression in machine learning
